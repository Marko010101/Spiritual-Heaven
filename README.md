--I am using the Supabase library for the backend. I have created four structured APIs for it: the first for bookings, the second for cabins, the third for guests, and the fourth for settings. the application is protected to avoid logining in without registration or without having an account. also the resources which is coming from supabase is protected and awailable for only registered users.
